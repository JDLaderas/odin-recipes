		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			This version of chicken fettuccine alfredo is lightened by substituting
			some of the heavy cream with chicken broth.
		</p>

		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>2 large boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
			<li>2 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
			<li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
			<li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
			<li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
			<li>2 egg yolks</li>
			<li>salt to taste</li>
			<li>1 pound fettuccine</li>
			<li>1 sprig chopped fresh parsley</li>
			<li>2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Directions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 1</h3>
				<p>
					Combine chicken breasts and chicken broth in a saucepan over
					medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low;
					simmer for 5 minutes. Turn breasts, cover, and simmer another 5
					minutes. Remove from heat and let sit with the cover on for 15
					minutes.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 2</h3>
				<p>
					Remove chicken breasts from the broth and set aside to cool, reserving
					the broth in the saucepan. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle,
					cut into bite-size slices.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 3</h3>
				<p>
					Return the chicken broth to medium heat and cook until reduced to 1
					cup.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 4</h3>
				<p>
					Stir garlic, black pepper, and heavy cream into the reduced broth;
					bring to a simmer and remove from heat.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 5</h3>
				<p>
					Whisk egg yolks in a bowl until smooth. Beat 1 tablespoon of the warm
					cream mixture into the eggs until thoroughly incorporated; repeat
					until about 1/2 cup of the warm cream mixture is used.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 6</h3>
				<p>
					Whisk the warm cream and egg mixture back into the saucepan with the
					remaining cream mixture. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking
					constantly, until the mixture almost comes to a simmer and thickens,
					about 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 7</h3>
				<p>
					Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fettuccine
					in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until nearly cooked through,
					about 7 minutes. Drain.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 8</h3>
				<p>
					Stir parsley, 1 cup of Parmigiano-Reggiano, and cream mixture into the
					pasta. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit for a few minutes until
					thick.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 9</h3>
				<p>
					Fold chicken and 1 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano into the pasta mixture to
					serve.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
